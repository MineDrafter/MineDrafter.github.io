Hi, I'm a german developer and student. <br>I can code in Java, C#, JavaScript and some other languages.<br>
I used to code Minecraft plug-ins for Minecraft-Servers <br>but I quickly came to Game<br>

I'm just one human in more than 7 BILLION others.<br> My life probably doesn't matter for you, <br>
