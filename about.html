<div class="about"> <p class="WhoAmI-Title">Who am I ?</p> <br> <p class="WhoAmI">
I'm a german developer who like to code games and used to code Minecraft plugins.<br>
My Favorite languages are C# (CSharp) and Java but I also code in JS/HTML/CSS.<br>
Coding is <u>currently</u> just my hobby, by the way.<br>
I also like gaming and mostly play Minecraft but also play some random games on itch.io.<br>
I'm interested in many cool stuff like the big universe and also the little details in our life<br>
as I'm philosophing around my life and ask myself the biggest questions.</p><br>
